# Shadow-removal-from-images

The system was implemented in Python version 3.8 using the Sublime Text editor. No assumption was made on the lighting conditions. Time taken for an image of size 256 X 256 is less than 5 seconds. The shadow region is made almost of the same illumination of non-shadow areas.
